# Get Involved

GOKb aims to create an open infrastructure and community surrounding
critical metadata for the management of electronic resources. In order
to continue to enhance GOKb’s services and data, the project needs to
make strides toward sustainability so that it can continue this work
into the future.

We invite organizations and individuals who believe in our mission to
help support GOKb through contributions of effort or financial support.

## Why become a partner?

- Support shared open infrastructure
- Improve data quality
- Share and enhance data

GOKb aims to make electronic resources metadata openly available to the
entire library community. Twice funded by the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation, GOKb is part of the transformation of scholarly
communication to an open, collaborative model that has to potential to
support a more efficient data flow across the supply chain. As an open
data project, GOKb will always offer its basic data and services free to
all users.

GOKb is community-managed, so we rely on our users to contribute data to
the knowledge base and to help with data enhancement and quality
control. Currently, GOKb maintenance is supported by Kuali OLE.

Library partners can directly influence the quality of GOKb by
contributing effort toward data collection and maintenance. Partners can
manage publisher packages or providers, add enhancements like title
history events, and make corrections as needed. Partners can collaborate
with GOKb on mutually beneficial data enhancement projects. Partners can
also share select metadata, such as unique identifiers, to promote
interoperability between services.
